# React + Vite Projects

This repository contains small projects (e.g., **ToDoList**) built using the fundamentals of **React.js**, developed during the summer break after my 1st year at **MIT Manipal**.

These projects are built with:

- ⚛️ React + Vite
- 📦 Functional Components & Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- 🧠 Core concepts like props, state, conditional rendering, and list rendering
